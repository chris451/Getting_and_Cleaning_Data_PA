## README

The folder "UCI HAR Dataset" needs to be in the working directory. The script "run_analysis.R" need to be in the working directory as well.

in RStudio the command:

source("run_analysis.R")

will fetch and run the Rscript run_analysis.R directly. The script writes the tidy data as a txt and a csv file.
